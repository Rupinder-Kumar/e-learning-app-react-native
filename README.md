React Native App for e-learning

## Install Node

Before starting, you'll need the Node package manager (NPM) for installing React and Expo. To install Node, you need to head to their site and [**download**](https://nodejs.org/en/) the version appropriate to your system. You can also install node using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (Mac only) if you prefer.

## Install Xcode

If you're on a Mac, I highly recommend [installing Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for the required **Command Line Tools** and for using the iOS Simulator. Xcode also comes with [Git](https://git-scm.com), which is wonderful for development.

## Install Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io) will allow us to have a development environment for creating our app. Go to Terminal and type this command and press Enter.
```sh
sudo npm install expo-cli --global
```

Go to their Quick Start [guide](https://expo.io/learn) for more detailed instructions.

Go to your new project's folder and start the environment.
```sh
expo start
```

## Install Libraries
```sh
npm install
```
